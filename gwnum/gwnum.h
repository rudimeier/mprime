|
| This file contains the headers and definitions that are used in the
| multi-precision IBDWT arithmetic routines.  That is, all routines
| that deal with the gwnum data type.
|
| Gwnums are great for applications that do a lot of multiplies modulo
| a number.  Only Intel x86-platforms are supported.  Add and subtract
| are also pretty fast.
|
| Gwnums are not suited to applications that need to convert to and from
| binary frequently or need to change the modulus frequently.
|
| MULTI-THREAD WARNING: You CAN perform gwnum operations in different
| threads IF AND ONLY IF each uses a different gwhandle structure
| initialized by gwinit.

/* INPUTS:

Input number (3 possibilities):

1) k,b,n,c set and num_being_factored_array = NULL.  k*b^n+c is factored.
2) k,b,n,c zero and num_being_factored_array set.  num_being_factored is
   worked on using generic 3-multiply reduction
3) k,b,n,c set and num_being_factored_array set.  num_being_factored is
   worked on - it must be a factor of k*b^n+c.

A_array, B1 are required

B1_done is optional.  Use it to resume a stage 1 calculation.

x_array, z_array is the starting point.  If z_array is not given, then
z is assumed to be one.

stop_check_proc is optional

options are defined above


   OUTPUTS:

On success:

   if z_array is NULL, then x_array is set to normalized point
   else x_array, z_array is set to the unnormalized point

On factor found:

   x_array is set to the factor found

On interrupt:

   B1_done is set to the last prime below B1 that was processed.
   If z_array != NULL (preferred) then x_array and z_array are set to the
current point.  The (x,z) point is not normalized because it will
be slow for large numbers.  This is unacceptable during system shutdown.
Caller must allocate x and z arrays large enough to hold any k*b^n+c value.
   If z_array == NULL, then a normalized x is returned. Caller must allocate
x array large enough to hold any value less than num_being_factored.
